# TASK B.
## 1. Created 2 resource bundles for both french-canadian and english-US
## 2. Creating a JSON array to retrieve the messsages from the resource-bundles
## 3. Created a service class that will handle the retrieval process.
    #we do this because:
    ## 1. it divides the responsibility into "Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)"
    ## 2. it also makes the logic more reusable
    ## etc.
## 4. added Junit5 & Mockito to pom.xml, IN CASE i want  to test the output from MessageService
